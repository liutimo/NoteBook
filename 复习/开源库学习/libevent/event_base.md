## active callback

```c++
struct evcallback_list *activequeues;
/** The length of the activequeues array */
int nactivequeues;
/** Number of total events active in this event_base */
int event_count_active;
/** Maximum number of total events active in this event_base */
int event_count_active_max;
```

`activequeues`对应的是一个 active ev_cb的队列数组，根据优先级将active ev_cb放置到相应的队列中。

```c++
static void
event_queue_insert_active(struct event_base *base, struct event_callback *evcb)
{
    //...
	EVUTIL_ASSERT(evcb->evcb_pri < base->nactivequeues);
	TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL(&base->activequeues[evcb->evcb_pri],
	    evcb, evcb_active_next);
}
```

`evcb_pri`值越小，对应的优先级最大。但是实际上，event_base初始化时，只有一个优先级。

```c++
//init evcb active queue
base->nactivequeues = npriorities;
for (i = 0; i < base->nactivequeues; ++i) {
	TAILQ_INIT(&base->activequeues[i]);
}
```
